# auto-pc-inventory
A usefull utility to make the work of somebody htat have to make an inventory of a big number of computers, using a docker container of a mysql server (using a google spreadsheet as data base at the branch:https://github.com/Atm0n/auto-pc-inventory/tree/automatic-computer-inventory(google-spreadshet)).
