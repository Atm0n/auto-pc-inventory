# auto-pc-inventory
inventory of the hardware and software of a pc, using a google spreadsheet as data base.
I've tried to use an existing platform but htat was too dificult and gave me a lot of troubles so, i decided to do it in my way.
It needs that you configure a google api spreadsheet and then yoau have it all done. So, enjoy.
Nothing more to add.
